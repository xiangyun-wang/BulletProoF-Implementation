# HDL Files Documentation
## BRAM RO Integration Test
This folder containes the HDL files that integrate the ring oscillator with the BRAM. The port mapping can be found in the constraint file provided in the folder/ 
## BRAM
BRAM test with the on-board integrated clock. 
## Calibration
This folder containes all HDL files needed for the calibration of MPS. A corresponding Vivado project can be found in the [Vivado Project](https://github.com/xiangyun-wang/BulletProoF-Implementation/tree/main/Vivado%20Project) folder. 
## RO
Implementation of ring oscillation based on LUT2. 
## SHA3
This folder contains the SHA3 implementation with a testbench file and a TCL script file. Simulation can be done using ModelSim or Vivado. 
## TDC
This folder contains all files required for TDC, including MPS_Offset.vhd, carry_chain.vhd and test_path.vhd. 
## Timing Data Generation Integration
This folder constains all HDL files needed for the timing data generation integration (Phase 1). A corresponding Vivado project can be found in [Vivado Project](https://github.com/xiangyun-wang/BulletProoF-Implementation/tree/main/Vivado%20Project) folder.
