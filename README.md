# BulletProoF-Implementation
## Introduction
This project focus on the implementation of a secure boot method for FPGAs, according to [this paper](https://github.com/xiangyun-wang/BulletProoF-Implementation/blob/main/BulletProoF%20Paper.pdf). On-board encryption key storage is avoided, and a Hardware-Embedded Delay Physical Unclonable Function(HELP) base key generation is used, to generated the encryption key each time the FPGA board boots.
