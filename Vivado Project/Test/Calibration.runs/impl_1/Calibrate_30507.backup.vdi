WARNING: [DRC LUTLP-2] Combinatorial Loop Allowed: 7 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. This loop has been identified in the constraints as being known and understood by use of the ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS property on a net in the loop. The cells in the loop are: Ring_Osc/first, Ring_Osc/ro_loop[0].flip, Ring_Osc/ro_loop[1].flip, Ring_Osc/ro_loop[2].flip, Ring_Osc/ro_loop[3].flip, Ring_Osc/ro_loop[4].flip, and Ring_Osc/ro_loop[5].flip.
