# Support Files Explanation
## Calibration_Data.xlsx
This file contains calibration data of MPS. Under room temperature, 7 sets of SWcon configurations are used to get the timing data. Tap points are also shown in the file, under the recorded data. Test results are also collected under 0 - 5 degrees and 65 - 70 degrees, with 2 SWcon configurations for each temperature range. 
## SHA3_Absorb.c
This file is used to verify the correctness of the VHDL implementation of SHA3. 
## pi_rotation.c
This file is the C version of Pi rotation step of SHA3. 
## round_constant.c
This file is used to calculate new round constants for our implementation of SHA3, detailed formula can be found in the report under root directory. 
## round_constant.txt
This file contains the newly calculated round constant
## theta.c
This file is the C version of Theta step of SHA3
